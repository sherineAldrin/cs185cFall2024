    "In this scenario, the weight has mass $m$ and the string has a certain \"stiffness\". Further, we may consider friction on the track as the mass moves back and forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Physical Setting\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three laws that describe the setting:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Hooke's Law\n",
    "Hooke's law dictates that a spring experiences a restoring force which is proportional to its displacement. The constant of proportionality ($k$) reflects the stiffness of the spring. The force is written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F_{Hooke} = -kx\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Friction\n",
    "An object in motion along a surface experiences a force proportional to its speed. The constant of proportionality ($\\mu$) reflects the \"bumpiness\" of the surface. The force is written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F_{friction} = -\\mu x'\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Newton's Second Law\n",
    "Newton's second law indicates that the forces on an object are equal to its mass times its acceleration, i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F = ma = mx''\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Differential Equation\n",
    "By equating the total force $F$ to that of friction and Hooke's law, we can formulate the differential equation for the solution as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x''(t) + \\frac{\\mu}{m}x'(t) + \\frac{k}{m}x(t) = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Initial Conditions\n",
    "If we'd like to predict the full trajectory of our mass on the spring through time we also need to have the initial conditions - where it starts and how fast it is moving. For this example, let's consider that we stretch the spring a give distance $x_0$ from is starting position and let it go from there. In other words:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "x(0) &= x_0\\\\\n",
    "x'(0) &= 0\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_0$ is the initial displacement of the weight and $0$ represents the initial velocity of the weight (at rest). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note:\n",
    "For this homework, assume that $\\mu = 0$ so that there is no friction and the equation simplifies to \n",
    "$$\n",
    "x''(t) + \\frac{k}{m}x(t) = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Complete the following parts with this assumption.\n",

    "#### Optional Challenge\n",

However, only some other values of tens such as 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 worked. Not 0.3 and 0.6 though which was interesting, so maybe it didn't work with multiples of three for some reason. 1 also worked but barely anything above that or else it was way out of our desired range or blew up. The delta_t's that gave us values within the same range as the analytical solution though seemed to be between 0 and 1. The numerical instabilites are maybe caused by the fact the delta_t makes it harder to plot. The errors seem to be when the plot function is called, so the delta_t probable changes the shape of the plot to impossible dimensions."
